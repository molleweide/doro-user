# tmux notes

i will learn more and more about this so it will be super awesome
in the end. i know that i will become a supr genious if the clock
hits 12 tonight which is when he magic starts to happen which is
the reason why you
might now want to do that which is not somehing that you would
do only in the worst case scenario which is why somebody
could think about his in he first place.

this file should be moved into the notes dir but i don't
know how to do this.

anyways i will try to collect nice tmux related links etc here.
