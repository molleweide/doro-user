# BALATERO MOLLEWEIDE TODO

# WEMUX

now i understand how wemux works kind of but it is still not there.

i don't know how to manage all of this tho. but at least i am getting it
to run now. which means that some day in the future it will be working.

if you don't know how to do this then you should just read a little bit and chill

so this is how you can work with big monitors and tmux. i really like this becaus
with a window manager like yabai all of the nice parts about tiling windors
is available to you on macos.
