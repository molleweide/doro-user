# BALATERO MOLLEWEIDE TODO
 
 ssssssss

don't optimize shit. just make it work by adding
the real instllers so that it works everywhere.
yeah dude. and then i will be able to move on.
it is stupid to optimize for something thti don't
know how it works actually at the core. instead
just walk through each istaller one by one and make shit
work

# BUILD 
build karabiner
build vimac

# QMK

- installer script > os keys



# VIM.SPOON

- prevent turn on when not in text field
    finder?
    webbrowser
    reaper vkb

    ask balatero for this. git issue

# KARABINER 
    cli refresh/remove complex rules
        goal -> gulp automatic build flow
        otherwise it still takes quite a lot of time 
        to test small nuances of karabiner. or at least
        the process could be much faster which would
        be nice.

4. show hidden files in dialog boxes / os modals?

# OPEN ON START UP
    alacritty > config?
    karabiner > config?
    hammerspoon > init.lua
    syncthing 


# VIMAC

- doesn't show in top bar in latest version (mojave)
- is it to use .config/vimac?
- 

# QUESTIONS

- stack/reddit
    turn off app-tips / disable all but
    only allow from calendar!!
