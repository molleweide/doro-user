# BALATERO MOLLEWEIDE TODO

remove my code/subdir projects.
only put the projects in code/
it becomes unmanageable otherwise..its to bad but that's how it is.
change the tmuxinator projects. that is not to big of a deal.

this is going to be so fucking awesome when i have become free
from the pain. i can just feel how fast i will be. i cannot do.
it comfortably. now but it will be so fucking fast when i have
gotten used to doig this. it is going to be so much using this
and codig fast as fuck. it will also b easy for me to switch toggle
linux since everything is setup asilly from he start.
i also wonder if there is an easy way to mirror yabai and
othr programs that i am using so that the experience becomes
as similar as possible. dude, creating a theme for reaper without
dynamic colors is going to be interesting. that is gong to take
a while so it is not somehing of high priority but it does make
sense when you are good at managing git repos. then pretty 
much anythng becomes possible since you can just shuffle stuff
around quite easilly with pimped out programs



1. get my body to work properly
2. use reaper on laptop main
3. only install projects into code/
    don't subdir?!
4. update all to big sur
