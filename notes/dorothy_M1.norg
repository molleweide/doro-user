* install dorothy on new m1 mac
    ~  when installing dorothy on a new system
    ~  complains about outdated bash version
        we should make a command that updates bash
        and sets the correct bash
            on my M1 mac bash was set to `/bin/bash`

    make sure that commands are added to path???
