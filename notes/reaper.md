# general

pass optional test dir arg to installer script.

rename all my own master branches to molleweide so that 
I always have a distinct name from fork masters or develop
branches. this makes things easier to manage i think.


reaper
reaper-keys
reaper-jsfx
    rename this project.

# rpp cmd util

# reaper app
remove auto-syntax module

# tmuxinator

# Reloading the theme
Each time we change something in the theme we have to reload it in reaper to see the changes.
You can do this in several ways:
– Press the “reload images” button in the Theme Development window
– run “Script: Lokasenna_Refresh current theme.lua”
– switch to another theme and back,
– using the SWS Resources window, if you have that set up.
