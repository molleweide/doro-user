# WINDOWS INSTALLER ??

# RELOADING THE THEME
Each time we change something in the theme we have to reload it in reaper to see the changes.
You can do this in several ways:
– Press the “reload images” button in the Theme Development window
– run “Script: Lokasenna_Refresh current theme.lua”
– switch to another theme and back,
– using the SWS Resources window, if you have that set up.
