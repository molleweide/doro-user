# RNDM

this is going to be so nice now that i understand
that the deepest wave in the body is the rotating 
of the hip and so doing that on the floor is the thing
that you want to do the most you can all of the 21:34and 
and so the next time we are going to 
i am going to try to find everything that has to do
with reaper and then use it code shit in reaer so that
i can really learn how to do some serious fucking midi
key shit. but now initially this will mean that I have
to make beats with the programming of the keys which
will be interesting but the more i do it the better 
it is going o become which is just magical. i am going
to bring some seriously fucking good shit into this so 
that i can do some crazy fucking midi programming and stuf
in reaper. it is just a controller but i reprogram all
of the kys so i don't want any midi processing
 to occure on he keyboard since i am using everything
in the end. this is some seriosly fucing fast shit thati
am going to do and when i have the tru ability to do this
i am going to do some seriousluy fucking good shit
on my github account.
