# RNDM

okay so now i am going to go to the gym to do some more technical
work. i am especially going to work on my lower back and do some
real agility work. this is going to be so nice because it is something
that i really feel am making me stronger. this is quite crazy actually
and it is something that i never thought that i would be doing but this
is the fucking shit tude

centromere

that is pretty fucking cool and then you can use gx for url's. this means
that i can remain for as long as I want inside of neovim and shit like
that. i shoul fork SWS extensions and also each of the big
reaper projects such as the package manager so that I can participate
in everything. this is super important i believe because it is somethig
that is going to make me fluid as fuck. and in the end then on ly
thing that i need to worry about is to get as good as possible at vim.

the better you ar at vim the faster you'll be at anything.
