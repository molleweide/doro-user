so this is pretty fucking nice because now i am going to be able
to do this fuckin shit. i just believe that this is because he's body is 
single threaded, or uncoordinated. he doesn't know how to do this which is something that is 
super fucking hard. you really have to do this with both hands so that you
can try  free rhythms in parallell to the second hand which will unlock you and
therefore it will make you become infinitely more coordinated. doing these are some
of the best things that you can ever do. never practice single threaded rhythms because
it makes you fucking stupid.
