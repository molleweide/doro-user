i just don't like to be told what do to. let me make up
my own mind and go fuck yourself.

dude det is really nice it is probably impossible to get a layout that
iy4s a hundred percent perfect but if you learn this one you'll be able to do
it really fucking well like a reall master and then be able to do it really fucking fast.

the story is one time i finally fought back. i broke the years of abuse and then blood 
was everywhere. she told me that she wanted me to beat her up a lot like a fucking monster bitch.

dude this is going to be the fuking best thing that we have ever done dude.

this is one of the best things ever. onec you can build one then you can pretty much
do any of them and get people and eyes on the shit this is where the magic is sarting to happen.
because now you can write faster than ever. this is an amazing program. you should totally
try out mine. my layout file is only one full page and it allows you to reach pretty much any
characters or symbols from within 5 by 3. and then you can add on top of this or mirror it
on any other ortholinear keyboard. this is nice because if ri know i can use my lpatop as base
then i can be sure that my layout will always work under any circumstances. this is pretty amazing.
it is the fastest framework that i have ever used man. this is just fucking insane dude.

and having this ability to pull davids stuff is really nice.

this is pretty fucking insane. this is the fastest thing that i have ever used
because this allows you to reach any characters that you'd use in any situation 
without ever having to lift your hands.
