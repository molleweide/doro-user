i have to get strong enough now tht i can work without problems and this
is only training. i have to work out as much as possible in this manner.

this is pretty fucking and so i don't want to.
and so now i just need to get as strong as i can so that i can
do the first thing that is in the fumblefucker.

hopefully 55 of them wil go out now that the 64 is out 
of the match. 60% of the x is the first y which you can give
up quite fast which is something that you might know.

this is so fucking annoying. but i do believe that this is strongly connected
to my lunges being to tight. i have to get better at this shit.

it will be hard but somehow i am going to fucking fix this. 

this is probably going to be the best software for music ever created.
