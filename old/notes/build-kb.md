question:

1. ask alex about nice!nano board | https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/gsszq7/ic_nicenano_the_super_thin_wireless_bluetooth/
2. did you create a custom model for your hand/finger dimensions?
3. check out my pointer functionality. it allows me to

== TOOLS == ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

plier / tÃ¥ng
tweezers / pincett

diode bend thingy?

magnet plate/jar?

== COMPONENTS == ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::;

- switches (silent)

- key caps

- controllers (2 = pro micro + adafruit)

- switch PCBs (optional)

* conductive tape

* diodes

* insulative tape

- LEDs > RGB WS2812B

* connector stripboard / breadboard
  makes insulation tape unnecessary

- rotary encoder (mixing??? wtf)

  https://www.amazon.com/momentary-switches/s?k=momentary+switches&page=2

* RJ9 (4pins)/ 3.5 trrs connectors/sockets (2)

  rj9 is safer than trs. if you pull out trs cable when online > creates a
  shorting of the circuit > not good aparently.

  rj9 is kind of reverse soldered on both sides. it is not the same?!
