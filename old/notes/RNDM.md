# MOLLEWEIDE DOTFILES RNDM

ok so now the question is how can we do this shit. it i
learn a bit of vimscript, lua . then make basic plugin and and form projects
then i will be able to really be floating with computers.
i can feel now that there is a state in the future where my core will be
so hard and powerfull that i will fucking be able to work without pain.

and that will be a point where i will be completely fluid with my body so that i can run jkump
walk lik down or do anything and work at the same time and this will make working as an engineer
an awesome jobb. i mean can you even imagine how viral such a vvideo would be.

i imagine that making that kind of stuff. i am working on some pretty cool stuff.

and my pinkies fucking suck. by now ofc i have a custom layout that works only for me but.

i hagve a website where i sell them and i can sell them for quite expensive.
