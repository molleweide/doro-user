# RNDM

I cannot imagine that this keyboard setup would affect the internal iterh vim bindings at all.

## slask issues
- gem install not working!!! colorls > ruby version
- macos keyboard framework https://github.com/molleweide/keyboard
- fork >>> https://github.com/jasonrudolph/keyboard >>> include into dotfiles > submodule


## RNDM

now this seems to work as it should which is very cool. but now I have to get 
a feel for how this works because it is definitely a bit different from 
typing on the ergodox
