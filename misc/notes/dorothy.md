# dorothy notes


- I am intrigued by your way of managing everything under commands/sources
    i note that the amount of files in the commands directory is huge
    what are the reasons for keeping everything in huge dirs like this and not split up more

- you are not conforming to XDG with configs?
    what are your comments on this?
    also how should I think about migrating my config files that I symlink.

- are you using a window manager? tmux?

- what 

- the exporting of DOROTHY inside `install.sh`
    does this exported variable persist between/over multiple terminal sessions?
    I tried to get it to work on my mac but I wasn't able to export properly.
