# DOROTHY NOTES


1. any paths that I setup will be ignored by dorothy?
2. in your dotfiles repo you don't keep any `dotfiles` or in other terms `config` files
    such as `.vimrc`, `.tmux.conf` or etc., does this mean that all of these
    are installed by dorothy `commands` for you??


## MIGRATE TO DOROTHY

- copy over dorothy into my dotfiles
- remove all setup files
- conform my own dotfiles
- which of my library functions already exist within dorothy?
