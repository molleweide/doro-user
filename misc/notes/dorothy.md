# DOROTHY NOTES

1. any paths that I setup will be ignored by dorothy?

2. in your dotfiles repo you don't keep any `dotfiles` or in other terms `config` files
    such as `.vimrc`, `.tmux.conf` or etc., does this mean that all of these
    are installed by dorothy `commands` for you??

    how would you advice me to manage these with dorothy.
    atm, I keep all of my config files in `dorothy/user/configs` and then I symlink all of these into
    `~/.config`

3. when should I put things in `export SETUP_UTILS=()` and when should I install things with eg. `brew`.
    Do you have somekind of heuristic for this?
