# DOTFILES RNDM

this is just so fucking nice because this really alows me to work with git
like a fucking wizard. this is extremely esoteric stuff because I have
had to learn this in order to be able to use some of the software that i ma
using when coding in haskell and haskell is a bit different and many
haskell users use a different versioning system so this is fucking insane.

so the goal now is to get to a level where i can manage everything in these
text files so that i never ever have fiddle around with and mess with

directrories in the browser or shell. instead i can just run this posix complian
script and it will make sure to install everything i want in every directory as neede.
anc so this is quite fucking dope my friend

dude this is so fucking amazing now because this is somethign that you cannot really
do that fast and so it is something that is quite fucking amazing.

of coures i do that. i have solved the problem and so there is nonthign more that i have
to do whixh is fucking amazing. and so that is something that is pretty fuckning cool.
