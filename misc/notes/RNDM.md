# DOTFILES RNDM

this is just so fucking nice because this really alows me to work with git
like a fucking wizard. this is extremely esoteric stuff because I have
had to learn this in order to be able to use some of the software that i ma
using when coding in haskell and haskell is a bit different and many
haskell users use a different versioning system so this is fucking insane.

so the goal now is to get to a level where i can manage everything in these
text files so that i never ever have fiddle around with and mess with

directrories in the browser or shell. instead i can just run this posix complian
script and it will make sure to install everything i want in every directory as neede.
anc so this is quite fucking dope my friend
