this is going to be fucking amazing and make me into a fucking wizard of programming music
since this is the way to go and so this will also allow me to type faster than a lazer beam
because my body is fuckig working again. so this is the shit and it is something that
will make sense that is the reason why this is so fuckig fast. fuck that system
it is much nicer to work in emacr or vim. vscode is for people that aren't hardcore enough
but vim is the fucking shit since it allows you to do most things like a lazars beeam
bugatti.

so now today I am going to test reaper and see if it works to update it on this mac and then
install it on my mac two which is going to be very interesting.
well maybe I could use two branches
