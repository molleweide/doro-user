this is amazing to do this kind of antirotation which is the reason why i have been feeling like shit
all mi life and so this is something that is quite fucking amzing so todo this kind of walking around
now is going to be super interesting.

now i am going to make sure that i use only the latest reaper config when i am coding and so 
so that I can stay super compatible and smooth which will mean that I can always work on any system
that I am on and so this will mean that my reaper system is working smooth as fuck and I am going to
start making really nice commit messages so that my developmen is super strong and powerful and 
not a fucking bitch that it has been before and so this will mean that I can produce anything that ri
like with my haskell based midi keyboard that is super fucking powerful.
